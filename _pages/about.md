The Media Integration and Communication Center (MICC) was established by the Italian Ministry for Education, University and Research at the University of Florence in 2001 as a Center of Excellence in the area of new media.

The MICC works as an interdisciplinary center for advanced research in the fields of computer vision, multimedia technologies applied to smart environments, natural interaction, Internet Based Applications and collective intelligence.

The center cooperates with national and international universities, research institutions and companies.

It has organised also events and conferences of international importance like ACM Multimedia 2010 and, lately, ECCV 2012.
